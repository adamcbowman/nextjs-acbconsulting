I have had the good fortune to work on the ProcessUnity platform for the past couple years at my job as the primary configuration analyst. 
ProcessUnity recently released a new certification, and I'm happy to say that I passed!

I am now a Certified ProcessUnity Platform Specialist.

My current full time engagement as an in house ProcessUnity configuration specialist is currently winding down, but I'm available for consulting and configuration work on ProcessUnity implementation projects.
