A while back I did one of [Scrimba's](https://scrimba.com/) weekly web dev challenges. This one was to create a digital business card using React to practice components and styling to a design template. 

Pretty pleased with how it turned out. 

I uploaded it to [Vercel](https://scrimba-react-business-card-aj9yfjiiy-adamcbowman.vercel.app/) to share with the world. Check it out on my [GitHub](https://github.com/adamcbowman/scrimba-React-business-card)
