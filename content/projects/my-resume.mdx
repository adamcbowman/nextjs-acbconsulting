A while back I had the idea to build a resume API, and a front end to display it, and over the past couple days put some time in to actually building it. 

It's online at [adambowman.tech](https://adambowman.tech)

Details about it are on the /about page there. It's built on the [JSON resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) standard. 

Its built in NextJs which makes it easy to build a frontend/backend to work together. 

You can send a GET request to https://adambowman.tech/api/resume if you want to get your JSON on! ðŸ¤“
