The famous [Sizzler BBQ](http://sizzlerbbq.com) was in need of a little website update. The existing site had been around for quite a while. We stuck with the basic design and content, but used the Gatsby/Tailwinds stack to modernize the look and feel, and make it more mobile layout friendly. 

In addition to the look and feel, the big improvement here was the Menu form. The old site used a static HTML form to get details on event booking (menu choices, location, etc)

React/Gatsby site tooling was used to build a custom form that dynamically generates a prices estimate, including a travel time charge that is based on the location and travel time (from the MapBox API)

The custom form passes information to a google form that handles the submission of the form. 

From there, Google apps Scripts is used to customize an email notification to the Sizzler team as well as an automated Google Calendar entry on the requested date. 

All running on free google/netlify hosting services.
