New Client site is live!

Big thanks to [Wilson & Farr Cleaning Solutions](http://wilsonfarrcleaningsolutions.com) for choosing acbConsulting to build their new site.
This project began as a simple SEO optimization inquiry, and turned into "Lets just build a whole new site!"

Techy details below, but if you're just here to see the finished product it's live at [wilsonfarrcleaningsolutions.com](http://wilsonfarrcleaningsolutions.com)

The nitty gritty is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/adamcbowman/wilsonFarr) if you're into that kinda thing <br />

WilsonFarr had already done an amazing job of creating a very visually appealing design using the GUI tool provided by their hosting provider. The issue was there was no way to define meta tags and the markup ended up being a nested mess of divs that the google bots didn't seem to like very much. 

Enter [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)<br />
Using Gatsby, I was able to write React code, then use the Gatsby build process to compile to static HTML. Because Gatsby compiles to statis HTML, we were able to move the hosting to [DreamHost](http://click.dreamhost.com/SHJ9) and actually save them a good bit compared to the monthly cost they were paying for the DIY hosting solution. 

For styling, I started with a great free [starter theme](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-lander) by [codebushi](https://codebushi.com/) which uses [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Beyond that the only other external code I reached for was the Slider component for the reviews on the main page. For that I found [React Slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/) which was easy to implement and did the job well and quicker than writing a DIY slider component. 

This was a great project for me. Was awesome to have a solid design to work from. Tailwinds is a breeze to work with. Will use that again for sure. Gatsby and the starter theme template got me up and running fast, and all in all I was pleased with the efficiency with which I was able to get the new site online. 

Get in touch if you've got a web site in need of a refresh and reduce your monthly webhosting costs if you're on a paid platform for self editing.
