Our CYC Club Race committee put together a list of preset race courses for various wind directions using marks of the harbour. 
We uploaded a spreadsheet to the [club website](https://cyc.pe.ca/racing/) and posted it for members to download. 
But of course, a spreadsheet doesn't view well on a phone.. 

So I put together a web view of the course list and added it to the timer app I made previously. 

The first couple courses even have a crudely drawn map to show the course.
